### API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. In short this is software that acts as an intermediary between two applications with the main purpose of allowing communication between the two applications. In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that your requesting from it and then delivers the response back to you.

#### Webscrapping
Webscrapping is the process of using a program or algorithm to extract and process large amounts of data from the web.

#### Type of Requests
Requests or HTTP requests characterise what action you are going to take by referring to the API.
- GET: For simple retrieval of information about your account, Droplets, or environment, you should use the GET method. The information you request will be returned to you as a JSON object.

The attributes defined by the JSON object can be used to form additional requests. Any request using the GET method is read-only and will not affect any of the objects you are querying.

- POST: To create a new object, your request should specify the POST method.

The POST request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new object. When you wish to create a new object, send a POST request to the target endpoint.

- PUT: To update the information about a resource in your account, the PUT method is available.

Like the DELETE Method, the PUT method is idempotent. It sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of their current values. Requests using the PUT method do not need to check the current attributes of the object.

###Â Vagrant
Vagrant
vagrant is a tool used by devops engineers to help build and configure virtual enivronments.
vagrant features can be broken down into a few key areas:
vangrantfile
boxes
networking
provisioning
plugins
vagrantfile
a vagrantfile is a configuration file that uses Ruby programming language syntax.
It is easy to understand ans can be quickly tested by making a change and then running the vagrant up to see whether the expected results have been implemented
vagrantfiles can easily be shared and added into version control.
its lightweight and contains everything needed for another user to replicate a virtual environment/application
Provisioning
Provisioning in Vagrant is a way to configure the vagrant machine.
Through provisioning you are able to install software dependencies as the machine is being created.
Advantages of Vagrant
Vagrant allows you the user to easily package up a virtual environment that can be shared with other developers.
These virtual environments can be configured to match the production environment of the application/code is running
This can help minimise the presence of bugs/errors when the code is deployed to the production environment
a big advantage of vagrant is the vagrant configuration file known as vagrantfile can be easily created, edited and tested.
The syntax of a vagrantfile is easy to understand and offers a simple way to build complex virtual environments
Vagrant and Developers
Vagrant gives access to developers to package up their code/application into an easily sharable fully-fledged development environment.
This can then be used by other developers who do not have the original production environment and are using different OS such as Linux, Windows or macOS.
Vagrant and Operations
The operations team can easily and quickly test deployment tools and scripts using vagrant.
Vagrant supports many popular deployment tools such as: Docker, Puppet and Chef.
- Virtual Box
- CI/CD
- Jenkins
- AWS
- VPC
