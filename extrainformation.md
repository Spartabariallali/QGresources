Virtualisation – in IT the concept of virtualisation is creating a virtual resource for example a server or an operating system, file, network or storage.

Virtual machines – virtual machines are virtual environments that simulate a physical computer in software form.

In my experience I have used `HashiCoprs vagrant which is a tool that is used for building and managing virtual machines. Vagrant is a powerful tool that lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and negates the “works on my machine excuse”

The reason why vagrant is such a poweful tool is because with one single file a virtual environment will be created and everything the developer requires will be installed at the same time. Other members of your team create their development environments from the same configuration, so whether your working on mac, linux or windows all your team members are running the code in the same environment, against the same dependencies, all configured the same way.
