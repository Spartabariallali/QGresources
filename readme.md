# Situation Action Task Result

## SQL - Structured Query Language

### SQL Mini Project

### ***Situation***

On the second week of the Sparta global training programming I was introduced to SQL (structured Query Language). In this week I learned the basics all the way up to intermediate functionalities of SQL including creating reading, updating and modify tables within a database.

### ***Task***

As a means to consolidate my knowledge and in order to showcase what I have learned practically, I was tasked with generating a report that required me to query the northwind database in order retrieve information which could then be packaged to show an end user.  

### ***Action***

I approached the task by firstly pseudo coding all the relevant queries within azure data studio to ensure that I can quickly and accurately Query the northwind database while minimising the potential of retrieving the wrong information. Once I had a basic outline of the queries - I began working through them systematically ensuring complete accuracy in my work. Once all the information was retrieved, I began working on the second iteration which was transforming the data into a user-friendly report that could be consumed by individuals who require the information elsewhere. I did so by using the taking advantage of the azure database plugins which allowed me to create powerfully informative graphs within seconds.  

### ***Result***

As a consequence of approaching the task iteratively, I was able to create a professional report that had the most up to date and accurate information ready to be used. The entire process taught me the value of employing my creativity as well technical skills as the raw output of first iteration may not have been appropriate to pass on to a final user. However,  knowing that the first iteration contained only the most accurate information allowed me to focus on making it more visually presentable for second iteration. This meant that I could efficiently retrieve and present the data within time and score highly on the project.

### Python basics/functions/methods/OOP

### ***Situation***

Going into week three of the spartaglobal training I was introduced to object-orientated programming in the form of python. Having very limited prior exposure to python I knew the following weeks were going to be a significant learning curve.  

### ***Task***

In order to keep up with the pace of the lessons and to make sure I solidify my knowledge on topics we have had already gone through. I took it upon myself to create an action plan that enabled me to keep learning effectively. I enlisted the help of a book called automate the boring stuff which focused specifically on python and gives the reader a thorough understanding of python's basic syntax across.

### ***Action***

Enlisting the aid of a book meant that I was able to go through many examples and tutorials as is the nature with learning programming it is important to embedded the knowledge via doing so that you build a solid exposure to different elements of coding. Going through the book meant I had a very good reference of everything we had learned and more which enabled me to grow in confidence when doing my own coding.

### ***Result***

As a result of perserving for many hours after class and going above and beyond what is expected of me, I completed all the python projects with relative which includes creating a calculator both functionally and with OOP as well as creating my own programming which uses an API call to retrieve data on football matches on that day.
